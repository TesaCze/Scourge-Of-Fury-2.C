# Scourge of Fury

## Overview

Scourge of Fury is a 2D dungeon-crawling game created as a semestral project by Vojtěch Sedláček (me) and Tobiáš Ondra (@TobanCZ) during our second year in high school. The game features an immersive dungeon environment where players can navigate through levels, defeat enemies, and explore various challenges.

## Gameplay

In Scourge of Fury, players control a knight armed with a sword and a limited number of hearts. The objective is to navigate through the dungeon, defeat enemies, and survive until the end.

## Features

- **Player Movement:** Navigate through the dungeon using arrow keys or WASD.
- **Combat:** Engage in real-time combat with enemies using a sword.
- **Health System:** Monitor your heart count as it decreases upon enemy attacks.
